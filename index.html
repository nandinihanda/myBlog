        <p>My hobby is Swimming. As well as being fun, swimming is a great way to keep fit and well and make friends.
            Swimming is a healthy activity that you can continue for a lifetime. Swimming is a low-impact activity that has many physical and mental health benefits.

             Swimming can provide you with a low-impact workout and itâ€™s also a good way to relax and feel good. Common swimming styles in recreational swimming are breaststroke, backstroke, side stroke and freestyle.<br><br>Swimming keeps your heart rate up but takes some of the impact stress off your body. It helps maintain a healthy weight, healthy heart and lungs.</p>
